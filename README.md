# Machine Learning Model Training and Evaluation

This project demonstrates an end-to-end workflow, from data preprocessing to saving the trained model for future use. It is suitable for beginners and intermediate-level practitioners looking to understand and implement machine learning pipelines.

## Features
- **Data Loading**: Import datasets in CSV format.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Handle missing values, encode categorical features, and scale numerical data.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualize and summarize data insights.
- **Model Training**: Train machine learning models using `scikit-learn`.
- **Model Evaluation**: Assess performance using metrics like accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification reports.
- **Model Saving**: Save the trained model for future predictions.

## Dependencies
To run the notebook, ensure the following Python libraries are installed:

- `numpy`
- `pandas`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`
- `scikit-learn`
- `joblib`

Install them using pip:
```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn joblib
```

## How to Use
1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-folder>
   ```

2. **Open the Notebook**:
   Launch Jupyter Notebook and open the `model.ipynb` file:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook model.ipynb
   ```

3. **Run the Cells**:
   Execute each cell sequentially to:
   - Load and preprocess your dataset.
   - Explore the data through visualizations.
   - Train and evaluate the model.
   - Save the trained model.

## Customization
- **Dataset**: Replace the placeholder dataset with your own CSV file.
- **Model**: Update the machine learning algorithm to suit your requirements.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Add or modify metrics as needed.

## Outputs
- Trained model file (e.g., `.joblib` or `.pkl`).
- Visualizations for EDA and performance evaluation.
- Console outputs for key metrics.
